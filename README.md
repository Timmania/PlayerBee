# Description of the project
A short description of the project.
Player Bee, contains a spelling bee game that purposes learning and entertainment while guessing Dutch words.
You will learn how to spell words, expand your vocabulary and push you to go on until you completed the hive.
Player Bee is important for those who will compete in an actual Dutch spelling bee contest or for those who would like to get comfortable with Dutch words.
The game displays a hive with 7 letters, 6 on the outside and 1 in the middle.
The player needs to make (Dutch) words that are atleast 4 letters long and contain the middle letter, the letters can be used more than once.
For every 4 word letter that they guess right, they get 1 point.
When the guess has 5 or more letters and it's right, the player gets 1 point for each letter.
The hive will automaticly renew when the player guesses all the words in the hive.
Player bee is made by three information science students at the RUG.
